Other Decode Variables
......................


`gnus-uu-grabbed-file-functions'
     All functions in this list will be called right after each file has
     been successfully decoded--so that you can move or view files right
     away, and don't have to wait for all files to be decoded before you
     can do anything.  Ready-made functions you can put in this list
     are:


     `gnus-uu-grab-view'
          View the file.

     `gnus-uu-grab-move'
          Move the file (if you're using a saving function.)

`gnus-uu-be-dangerous'
     Specifies what to do if unusual situations arise during decoding.
     If `nil', be as conservative as possible.  If `t', ignore things
     that didn't work, and overwrite existing files.  Otherwise, ask
     each time.

`gnus-uu-ignore-files-by-name'
     Files with name matching this regular expression won't be viewed.

`gnus-uu-ignore-files-by-type'
     Files with a MIME type matching this variable won't be viewed.
     Note that Gnus tries to guess what type the file is based on the
     name.  `gnus-uu' is not a MIME package (yet), so this is slightly
     kludgey.

`gnus-uu-tmp-dir'
     Where `gnus-uu' does its work.

`gnus-uu-do-not-unpack-archives'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu' won't peek inside archives looking
     for files to display.

`gnus-uu-view-and-save'
     Non-`nil' means that the user will always be asked to save a file
     after viewing it.

`gnus-uu-ignore-default-view-rules'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu' will ignore the default viewing
     rules.

`gnus-uu-ignore-default-archive-rules'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu' will ignore the default archive
     unpacking commands.

`gnus-uu-kill-carriage-return'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu' will strip all carriage returns from
     articles.

`gnus-uu-unmark-articles-not-decoded'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu' will mark unsuccessfully decoded
     articles as unread.

`gnus-uu-correct-stripped-uucode'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu' will *try* to fix uuencoded files
     that have had trailing spaces deleted.

`gnus-uu-view-with-metamail'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu' will ignore the viewing commands
     defined by the rule variables and just fudge a MIME content type
     based on the file name.  The result will be fed to `metamail' for
     viewing.

`gnus-uu-save-in-digest'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu', when asked to save without
     decoding, will save in digests.  If this variable is `nil',
     `gnus-uu' will just save everything in a file without any
     embellishments.  The digesting almost conforms to RFC1153--no easy
     way to specify any meaningful volume and issue numbers were found,
     so I simply dropped them.





File: gnus, Node: Uuencoding and Posting, Prev: Other Decode Variables, Up: Decoding Variables

Uuencoding and Posting
......................


`gnus-uu-post-include-before-composing'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu' will ask for a file to encode before
     you compose the article.  If this variable is `t', you can either
     include an encoded file with `C-c C-i' or have one included for you
     when you post the article.

`gnus-uu-post-length'
     Maximum length of an article.  The encoded file will be split into
     how many articles it takes to post the entire file.

`gnus-uu-post-threaded'
     Non-`nil' means that `gnus-uu' will post the encoded file in a
     thread.  This may not be smart, as no other decoder I have seen is
     able to follow threads when collecting uuencoded articles.  (Well,
     I have seen one package that does that---`gnus-uu', but somehow, I
     don't think that counts...) Default is `nil'.

`gnus-uu-post-separate-description'
     Non-`nil' means that the description will be posted in a separate
     article.  The first article will typically be numbered (0/x).  If
     this variable is `nil', the description the user enters will be
     included at the beginning of the first article, which will be
     numbered (1/x).  Default is `t'.





File: gnus, Node: Viewing Files, Prev: Decoding Variables, Up: Decoding Articles

Viewing Files
-------------

After decoding, if the file is some sort of archive, Gnus will attempt
to unpack the archive and see if any of the files in the archive can be
viewed.  For instance, if you have a gzipped tar file `pics.tar.gz'
containing the files `pic1.jpg' and `pic2.gif', Gnus will uncompress and
de-tar the main file, and then view the two pictures.  This unpacking
process is recursive, so if the archive contains archives of archives,
it'll all be unpacked.

Finally, Gnus will normally insert a "pseudo-article" for each extracted
file into the summary buffer.  If you go to these "articles", you will
be prompted for a command to run (usually Gnus will make a suggestion),
and then the command will be run.

If `gnus-view-pseudo-asynchronously' is `nil', Emacs will wait until the
viewing is done before proceeding.

If `gnus-view-pseudos' is `automatic', Gnus will not insert the
pseudo-articles into the summary buffer, but view them immediately.  If
this variable is `not-confirm', the user won't even be asked for a
confirmation before viewing is done.

If `gnus-view-pseudos-separately' is non-`nil', one pseudo-article will
be created for each file to be viewed.  If `nil', all files that use the
same viewing command will be given as a list of parameters to that
command.

If `gnus-insert-pseudo-articles' is non-`nil', insert pseudo-articles
when decoding.  It is `t' by default.

So; there you are, reading your *pseudo-articles* in your
*virtual newsgroup* from the *virtual server*; and you think:
Why isn't anything real anymore? How did we get here?

Article Treatment
=================

Reading through this huge manual, you may have quite forgotten that the
object of newsreaders is to actually, like, read what people have
written.  Reading articles.  Unfortunately, people are quite bad at
writing, so there are tons of functions and variables to make reading
these articles easier.

* Menu:

* Article Highlighting::    You want to make the article look like fruit salad.
* Article Fontisizing::     Making emphasized text look niced.
* Article Hiding::          You also want to make certain info go away.
* Article Washing::         Lots of way-neat functions to make life better.
* Article Buttons::         Click on URLs, Message-IDs, addresses and the like.
* Article Date::            Grumble, UT!
* Article Signature::       What is a signature?




File: gnus, Node: Article Highlighting, Next: Article Fontisizing, Prev: Article Treatment, Up: Article Treatment

Article Highlighting
--------------------

Not only do you want your article buffer to look like fruit salad, but
you want it to look like technicolor fruit salad.


`W H a'
     Highlight the current article (`gnus-article-highlight').

`W H h'
     Highlight the headers (`gnus-article-highlight-headers').  The
     highlighting will be done according to the `gnus-header-face-alist'
     variable, which is a list where each element has the form (REGEXP
     NAME CONTENT).  REGEXP is a regular expression for matching the
     header, NAME is the face used for highlighting the header name and
     CONTENT is the face for highlighting the header value.  The first
     match made will be used.  Note that REGEXP shouldn't have `^'
     prepended--Gnus will add one.

`W H c'
     Highlight cited text (`gnus-article-highlight-citation').

     Some variables to customize the citation highlights:


     `gnus-cite-parse-max-size'
          If the article size if bigger than this variable (which is
          25000 by default), no citation highlighting will be performed.

     `gnus-cite-prefix-regexp'
          Regexp matching the longest possible citation prefix on a
          line.

     `gnus-cite-max-prefix'
          Maximum possible length for a citation prefix (default 20).

     `gnus-cite-face-list'
          List of faces used for highlighting citations.  When there are
          citations from multiple articles in the same message, Gnus
          will try to give each citation from each article its own face.
          This should make it easier to see who wrote what.

     `gnus-supercite-regexp'
          Regexp matching normal Supercite attribution lines.

     `gnus-supercite-secondary-regexp'
          Regexp matching mangled Supercite attribution lines.

     `gnus-cite-minimum-match-count'
          Minimum number of identical prefixes we have to see before we
          believe that it's a citation.

     `gnus-cite-attribution-prefix'
          Regexp matching the beginning of an attribution line.

     `gnus-cite-attribution-suffix'
          Regexp matching the end of an attribution line.

     `gnus-cite-attribution-face'
          Face used for attribution lines.  It is merged with the face
          for the cited text belonging to the attribution.



`W H s'
     Highlight the signature (`gnus-article-highlight-signature').
     Everything after `gnus-signature-separator' (*Note Article
     Signature::) in an article will be considered a signature and will
     be highlighted with `gnus-signature-face', which is `italic' by
     default.





File: gnus, Node: Article Fontisizing, Next: Article Hiding, Prev: Article Highlighting, Up: Article Treatment

Article Fontisizing
-------------------

People commonly add emphasis to words in news articles by writing things
like `_this_' or `*this*'.  Gnus can make this look nicer by running the
article through the `W e' (`gnus-article-emphasize') command.

How the emphasis is computed is controlled by the
`gnus-article-emphasis' variable.  This is an alist where the first
element is a regular expression to be matched.  The second is a number
that says what regular expression grouping is used to find the entire
emphasized word.  The third is a number that says what regexp grouping
should be displayed and highlighted.  (The text between these two
groupings will be hidden.)  The fourth is the face used for
highlighting.

     (setq gnus-article-emphasis
           '(("_\\(\\w+\\)_" 0 1 gnus-emphasis-underline)
             ("\\*\\(\\w+\\)\\*" 0 1 gnus-emphasis-bold)))

By default, there are seven rules, and they use the following faces:
`gnus-emphasis-bold', `gnus-emphasis-italic', `gnus-emphasis-underline',
`gnus-emphasis-bold-italic', `gnus-emphasis-underline-italic',
`gnus-emphasis-underline-bold', and
`gnus-emphasis-underline-bold-italic'.

If you want to change these faces, you can either use `M-x customize',
or you can use `copy-face'.  For instance, if you want to make
`gnus-emphasis-italic' use a red face instead, you could say something
like:

     (copy-face 'red 'gnus-emphasis-italic)




File: gnus, Node: Article Hiding, Next: Article Washing, Prev: Article Fontisizing, Up: Article Treatment

Article Hiding
--------------

Or rather, hiding certain things in each article.  There usually is much
too much cruft in most articles.


`W W a'
     Do maximum hiding on the summary buffer (`gnus-article-hide').

`W W h'
     Hide headers (`gnus-article-hide-headers').  *Note Hiding
     Headers::.

`W W b'
     Hide headers that aren't particularly interesting
     (`gnus-article-hide-boring-headers').  *Note Hiding Headers::.

`W W s'
     Hide signature (`gnus-article-hide-signature').  *Note Article
     Signature::.

`W W p'
     Hide PGP signatures (`gnus-article-hide-pgp').  The
     `gnus-article-hide-pgp-hook' hook will be run after a PGP signature
     has been hidden.

`W W P'
     Hide PEM (privacy enhanced messages) cruft
     (`gnus-article-hide-pem').

`W W c'
     Hide citation (`gnus-article-hide-citation').  Some variables for
     customizing the hiding:


     `gnus-cite-hide-percentage'
          If the cited text is of a bigger percentage than this variable
          (default 50), hide the cited text.

     `gnus-cite-hide-absolute'
          The cited text must have at least this length (default 10)
          before it is hidden.

     `gnus-cited-text-button-line-format'
          Gnus adds buttons to show where the cited text has been
          hidden, and to allow toggle hiding the text.  The format of
          the variable is specified by this format-like variable (*Note
          Formatting Variables::).  These specs are legal:

          `b'
               Start point of the hidden text.
          `e'
               End point of the hidden text.
          `l'
               Length of the hidden text.

     `gnus-cited-lines-visible'
          The number of lines at the beginning of the cited text to
          leave shown.


`W W C'
     Hide cited text in articles that aren't roots
     (`gnus-article-hide-citation-in-followups').  This isn't very
     useful as an interactive command, but might be a handy function to
     stick in `gnus-article-display-hook' (*Note Customizing
     Articles::).


All these "hiding" commands are toggles, but if you give a negative
prefix to these commands, they will show what they have previously
hidden.  If you give a positive prefix, they will always hide.

Also *Note Article Highlighting:: for further variables for citation
customization.




File: gnus, Node: Article Washing, Next: Article Buttons, Prev: Article Hiding, Up: Article Treatment

Article Washing
---------------

We call this "article washing" for a really good reason.  Namely, the
`A' key was taken, so we had to use the `W' key instead.

"Washing" is defined by us as "changing something from something to
something else", but normally results in something looking better.
Cleaner, perhaps.


`W l'
     Remove page breaks from the current article
     (`gnus-summary-stop-page-breaking').

`W r'
     Do a Caesar rotate (rot13) on the article buffer
     (`gnus-summary-caesar-message').

`W t'
     Toggle whether to display all headers in the article buffer
     (`gnus-summary-toggle-header').

`W v'
     Toggle whether to display all headers in the article buffer
     permanently (`gnus-summary-verbose-header').

`W m'
     Toggle whether to run the article through MIME before displaying
     (`gnus-summary-toggle-mime').

`W o'
     Treat overstrike (`gnus-article-treat-overstrike').

`W w'
     Do word wrap (`gnus-article-fill-cited-article').  If you use this
     function in `gnus-article-display-hook', it should be run fairly
     late and certainly after any highlighting.

     You can give the command a numerical prefix to specify the width to
     use when filling.

`W c'
     Remove CR (`gnus-article-remove-cr').

`W q'
     Treat quoted-printable (`gnus-article-de-quoted-unreadable').

`W f'
     Look for and display any X-Face headers
     (`gnus-article-display-x-face').  The command executed by this
     function is given by the `gnus-article-x-face-command' variable.
     If this variable is a string, this string will be executed in a
     sub-shell.  If it is a function, this function will be called with
     the face as the argument.  If the `gnus-article-x-face-too-ugly'
     (which is a regexp) matches the `From' header, the face will not be
     shown.  The default action under Emacs is to fork off an `xv' to
     view the face; under XEmacs the default action is to display the
     face before the `From' header.  (It's nicer if XEmacs has been
     compiled with X-Face support--that will make display somewhat
     faster.  If there's no native X-Face support, Gnus will try to
     convert the `X-Face' header using external programs from the
     `pbmplus' package and friends.)  If you want to have this function
     in the display hook, it should probably come last.

`W b'
     Add clickable buttons to the article (`gnus-article-add-buttons').

`W B'
     Add clickable buttons to the article headers
     (`gnus-article-add-buttons-to-head').

`W E l'
     Remove all blank lines from the beginning of the article
     (`gnus-article-strip-leading-blank-lines').

`W E m'
     Replace all blank lines with empty lines and then all multiple
     empty lines with a single empty line.
     (`gnus-article-strip-multiple-blank-lines').

`W E t'
     Remove all blank lines at the end of the article
     (`gnus-article-remove-trailing-blank-lines').

`W E a'
     Do all the three commands above (`gnus-article-strip-blank-lines').

`W E s'
     Remove all white space from the beginning of all lines of the
     article body (`gnus-article-strip-leading-space').





File: gnus, Node: Article Buttons, Next: Article Date, Prev: Article Washing, Up: Article Treatment

Article Buttons
---------------

People often include references to other stuff in articles, and it would
be nice if Gnus could just fetch whatever it is that people talk about
with the minimum of fuzz.

Gnus adds "buttons" to certain standard references by default:
Well-formed URLs, mail addresses and Message-IDs.  This is controlled by
two variables, one that handles article bodies and one that handles
article heads:


`gnus-button-alist'
     This is an alist where each entry has this form:

          (REGEXP BUTTON-PAR USE-P FUNCTION DATA-PAR)


     REGEXP
          All text that match this regular expression will be considered
          an external reference.  Here's a typical regexp that matches
          embedded URLs: `<URL:\\([^\n\r>]*\\)>'.

     BUTTON-PAR
          Gnus has to know which parts of the matches is to be
          highlighted.  This is a number that says what sub-expression
          of the regexp is to be highlighted.  If you want it all
          highlighted, you use 0 here.

     USE-P
          This form will be `eval'ed, and if the result is non-`nil',
          this is considered a match.  This is useful if you want extra
          sifting to avoid false matches.

     FUNCTION
          This function will be called when you click on this button.

     DATA-PAR
          As with BUTTON-PAR, this is a sub-expression number, but this
          one says which part of the match is to be sent as data to
          FUNCTION.


     So the full entry for buttonizing URLs is then

          ("<URL:\\([^\n\r>]*\\)>" 0 t gnus-button-url 1)

`gnus-header-button-alist'
     This is just like the other alist, except that it is applied to the
     article head only, and that each entry has an additional element
     that is used to say what headers to apply the buttonize coding to:

          (HEADER REGEXP BUTTON-PAR USE-P FUNCTION DATA-PAR)

     HEADER is a regular expression.

`gnus-button-url-regexp'
     A regular expression that matches embedded URLs.  It is used in the
     default values of the variables above.

`gnus-article-button-face'
     Face used on buttons.

`gnus-article-mouse-face'
     Face used when the mouse cursor is over a button.





File: gnus, Node: Article Date, Next: Article Signature, Prev: Article Buttons, Up: Article Treatment

Article Date
------------

The date is most likely generated in some obscure timezone you've never
heard of, so it's quite nice to be able to find out what the time was
when the article was sent.


`W T u'
     Display the date in UT (aka. GMT, aka ZULU)
     (`gnus-article-date-ut').

`W T l'
     Display the date in the local timezone (`gnus-article-date-local').

`W T s'
     Display the date using a user-defined format
     (`gnus-article-date-user').  The format is specified by the
     `gnus-article-time-format' variable, and is a string that's passed
     to `format-time-string'.  See the documentation of that variable
     for a list of possible format specs.

`W T e'
     Say how much time has elapsed between the article was posted and
     now (`gnus-article-date-lapsed').

`W T o'
     Display the original date (`gnus-article-date-original').  This can
     be useful if you normally use some other conversion function and are
     worried that it might be doing something totally wrong.  Say, claiming
     that the article was posted in 1854.  Although something like that is
     *totally* impossible.  Don't you trust me? *titter*





File: gnus, Node: Article Signature, Prev: Article Date, Up: Article Treatment

Article Signature
-----------------

Each article is divided into two parts--the head and the body.  The body
can be divided into a signature part and a text part.  The variable that
says what is to be considered a signature is `gnus-signature-separator'.
This is normally the standard `^-- $' as mandated by son-of-RFC 1036.
However, many people use non-standard signature separators, so this
variable can also be a list of regular expressions to be tested, one by
one.  (Searches are done from the end of the body towards the
beginning.)  One likely value is:

     (setq gnus-signature-separator
           '("^-- $"         ; The standard
             "^-- *$"        ; A common mangling
             "^-------*$"    ; Many people just use a looong 
                             ; line of dashes.  Shame!
             "^ *--------*$" ; Double-shame!
             "^________*$"   ; Underscores are also popular
             "^========*$")) ; Pervert!

The more permissive you are, the more likely it is that you'll get false
positives.

`gnus-signature-limit' provides a limit to what is considered a
signature.

  1. If it is an integer, no signature may be longer (in characters)
     than that integer.
  2. If it is a floating point number, no signature may be longer (in
     lines) than that number.
  3. If it is a function, the function will be called without any
     parameters, and if it returns `nil', there is no signature in the
     buffer.
  4. If it is a string, it will be used as a regexp.  If it matches, the
     text in question is not a signature.

This variable can also be a list where the elements may be of the types
listed above.




File: gnus, Node: Article Commands, Next: Summary Sorting, Prev: Article Treatment, Up: The Summary Buffer

Article Commands
================


`A P'
     Generate and print a PostScript image of the article buffer
     (`gnus-summary-print-article').  `gnus-ps-print-hook' will be run
     just before printing the buffer.





File: gnus, Node: Summary Sorting, Next: Finding the Parent, Prev: Article Commands, Up: The Summary Buffer

Summary Sorting
===============

You can have the summary buffer sorted in various ways, even though I
can't really see why you'd want that.


`C-c C-s C-n'
     Sort by article number (`gnus-summary-sort-by-number').

`C-c C-s C-a'
     Sort by author (`gnus-summary-sort-by-author').

`C-c C-s C-s'
     Sort by subject (`gnus-summary-sort-by-subject').

`C-c C-s C-d'
     Sort by date (`gnus-summary-sort-by-date').

`C-c C-s C-l'
     Sort by lines (`gnus-summary-sort-by-lines').

`C-c C-s C-i'
     Sort by score (`gnus-summary-sort-by-score').

These functions will work both when you use threading and when you don't
use threading.  In the latter case, all summary lines will be sorted,
line by line.  In the former case, sorting will be done on a
root-by-root basis, which might not be what you were looking for.  To
toggle whether to use threading, type `T T' (*Note Thread Commands::).




File: gnus, Node: Finding the Parent, Next: Alternative Approaches, Prev: Summary Sorting, Up: The Summary Buffer

Finding the Parent
==================

If you'd like to read the parent of the current article, and it is not
displayed in the summary buffer, you might still be able to.  That is,
if the current group is fetched by NNTP, the parent hasn't expired and
the `References' in the current article are not mangled, you can just
press `^' or `A r' (`gnus-summary-refer-parent-article').  If everything
goes well, you'll get the parent.  If the parent is already displayed in
the summary buffer, point will just move to this article.

If given a positive numerical prefix, fetch that many articles back into
the ancestry.  If given a negative numerical prefix, fetch just that
ancestor.  So if you say `3 ^', Gnus will fetch the parent, the
grandparent and the grandgrandparent of the current article.  If you say
`-3 ^', Gnus will only fetch the grandgrandparent of the current
article.

You can have Gnus fetch all articles mentioned in the `References'
header of the article by pushing `A R'
(`gnus-summary-refer-references').

You can also ask the NNTP server for an arbitrary article, no matter
what group it belongs to.  `M-^' (`gnus-summary-refer-article') will ask
you for a `Message-ID', which is one of those long, hard-to-read
thingies that look something like `<38o6up$6f2@hymir.ifi.uio.no>'.  You
have to get it all exactly right.  No fuzzy searches, I'm afraid.

The current select method will be used when fetching by `Message-ID'
from non-news select method, but you can override this by giving this
command a prefix.

If the group you are reading is located on a backend that does not
support fetching by `Message-ID' very well (like `nnspool'), you can set
`gnus-refer-article-method' to an NNTP method.  It would, perhaps, be
best if the NNTP server you consult is the one updating the spool you
are reading from, but that's not really necessary.

Most of the mail backends support fetching by `Message-ID', but do not
do a particularly excellent job at it.  That is, `nnmbox' and `nnbabyl'
are able to locate articles from any groups, while `nnml' and `nnfolder'
are only able to locate articles that have been posted to the current
group.  (Anything else would be too time consuming.)  `nnmh' does not
support this at all.

Alternative Approaches
======================

Different people like to read news using different methods.  This being
Gnus, we offer a small selection of minor modes for the summary buffers.

* Menu:

* Pick and Read::               First mark articles and then read them.
* Binary Groups::               Auto-decode all articles.




File: gnus, Node: Pick and Read, Next: Binary Groups, Prev: Alternative Approaches, Up: Alternative Approaches

Pick and Read
-------------

Some newsreaders (like `nn' and, uhm, `Netnews' on VM/CMS) use a
two-phased reading interface.  The user first marks in a summary buffer
the articles she wants to read.  Then she starts reading the articles
with just an article buffer displayed.

Gnus provides a summary buffer minor mode that allows
this---`gnus-pick-mode'.  This basically means that a few process mark
commands become one-keystroke commands to allow easy marking, and it
provides one additional command for switching to the summary buffer.

Here are the available keystrokes when using pick mode:

`.'
     Pick the article on the current line
     (`gnus-summary-mark-as-processable').  If given a numerical prefix,
     go to that article and pick it.  (The line number is normally
     displayed at the beginning of the summary pick lines.)

`SPACE'
     Scroll the summary buffer up one page (`gnus-pick-next-page').  If
     at the end of the buffer, start reading the picked articles.

`u'
     Unpick the article (`gnus-summary-unmark-as-processable').

`U'
     Unpick all articles (`gnus-summary-unmark-all-processable').

`t'
     Pick the thread (`gnus-uu-mark-thread').

`T'
     Unpick the thread (`gnus-uu-unmark-thread').

`r'
     Pick the region (`gnus-uu-mark-region').

`R'
     Unpick the region (`gnus-uu-unmark-region').

`e'
     Pick articles that match a regexp (`gnus-uu-mark-by-regexp').

`E'
     Unpick articles that match a regexp (`gnus-uu-unmark-by-regexp').

`b'
     Pick the buffer (`gnus-uu-mark-buffer').

`B'
     Unpick the buffer (`gnus-uu-unmark-buffer').

`RET'
     Start reading the picked articles (`gnus-pick-start-reading').  If
     given a prefix, mark all unpicked articles as read first.  If
     `gnus-pick-display-summary' is non-`nil', the summary buffer will
     still be visible when you are reading.


If this sounds like a good idea to you, you could say:

     (add-hook 'gnus-summary-mode-hook 'gnus-pick-mode)

`gnus-pick-mode-hook' is run in pick minor mode buffers.

If `gnus-mark-unpicked-articles-as-read' is non-`nil', mark all unpicked
articles as read.  The default is `nil'.

The summary line format in pick mode is slightly different from the
standard format.  At the beginning of each line the line number is
displayed.  The pick mode line format is controlled by the
`gnus-summary-pick-line-format' variable (*Note Formatting Variables::).
It accepts the same format specs that `gnus-summary-line-format' does
(*Note Summary Buffer Lines::).




File: gnus, Node: Binary Groups, Prev: Pick and Read, Up: Alternative Approaches

Binary Groups
-------------

If you spend much time in binary groups, you may grow tired of hitting
`X u', `n', `RET' all the time.  `M-x gnus-binary-mode' is a minor mode
for summary buffers that makes all ordinary Gnus article selection
functions uudecode series of articles and display the result instead of
just displaying the articles the normal way.

The only way, in fact, to see the actual articles is the `g' command,
when you have turned on this mode (`gnus-binary-show-article').

`gnus-binary-mode-hook' is called in binary minor mode buffers.




File: gnus, Node: Tree Display, Next: Mail Group Commands, Prev: Alternative Approaches, Up: The Summary Buffer

Tree Display
============

If you don't like the normal Gnus summary display, you might try setting
`gnus-use-trees' to `t'.  This will create (by default) an additional
"tree buffer".  You can execute all summary mode commands in the tree
buffer.

There are a few variables to customize the tree display, of course:

`gnus-tree-mode-hook'
     A hook called in all tree mode buffers.

`gnus-tree-mode-line-format'
     A format string for the mode bar in the tree mode buffers.  The
     default is `Gnus: %%b [%A] %Z'.  For a list of legal specs, *Note
     Summary Buffer Mode Line::.

`gnus-selected-tree-face'
     Face used for highlighting the selected article in the tree buffer.
     The default is `modeline'.

`gnus-tree-line-format'
     A format string for the tree nodes.  The name is a bit of a
     misnomer, though--it doesn't define a line, but just the node.  The
     default value is `%(%[%3,3n%]%)', which displays the first three
     characters of the name of the poster.  It is vital that all nodes
     are of the same length, so you *must* use `%4,4n'-like specifiers.

     Legal specs are:

     `n'
          The name of the poster.
     `f'
          The `From' header.
     `N'
          The number of the article.
     `['
          The opening bracket.
     `]'
          The closing bracket.
     `s'
          The subject.

     *Note Formatting Variables::.

     Variables related to the display are:

     `gnus-tree-brackets'
          This is used for differentiating between "real" articles and
          "sparse" articles.  The format is ((REAL-OPEN . REAL-CLOSE)
          (SPARSE-OPEN . SPARSE-CLOSE) (DUMMY-OPEN . DUMMY-CLOSE)), and
          the default is `((?[ . ?]) (?( . ?)) (?{ . ?}))'.

     `gnus-tree-parent-child-edges'
          This is a list that contains the characters used for
          connecting parent nodes to their children.  The default is
          `(?- ?\\ ?|)'.


`gnus-tree-minimize-window'
     If this variable is non-`nil', Gnus will try to keep the tree
     buffer as small as possible to allow more room for the other Gnus
     windows.  If this variable is a number, the tree buffer will never
     be higher than that number.  The default is `t'.  Note that if you
     have several windows displayed side-by-side in a frame and the tree
     buffer is one of these, minimizing the tree window will also resize
     all other windows displayed next to it.

`gnus-generate-tree-function'
     The function that actually generates the thread tree.  Two
     predefined functions are available: `gnus-generate-horizontal-tree'
     and `gnus-generate-vertical-tree' (which is the default).


Here's an example from a horizontal tree buffer:

     {***}-(***)-[odd]-[Gun]
          |      \[Jan]
          |      \[odd]-[Eri]
          |      \(***)-[Eri]
          |            \[odd]-[Paa]
          \[Bjo]
          \[Gun]
          \[Gun]-[Jor]

Here's the same thread displayed in a vertical tree buffer:

     {***}
       |--------------------------\-----\-----\
     (***)                         [Bjo] [Gun] [Gun]
       |--\-----\-----\                          |
     [odd] [Jan] [odd] (***)                   [Jor]
       |           |     |--\
     [Gun]       [Eri] [Eri] [odd]
                               |
                             [Paa]

If you're using horizontal trees, it might be nice to display the trees
side-by-side with the summary buffer.  You could add something like the
following to your `.gnus.el' file:

     (setq gnus-use-trees t
           gnus-generate-tree-function 'gnus-generate-horizontal-tree
           gnus-tree-minimize-window nil)
     (gnus-add-configuration
      '(article
        (vertical 1.0
                  (horizontal 0.25
                              (summary 0.75 point)
                              (tree 1.0))
                  (article 1.0))))

*Note Windows Configuration::.




File: gnus, Node: Mail Group Commands, Next: Various Summary Stuff, Prev: Tree Display, Up: The Summary Buffer

Mail Group Commands
===================

Some commands only make sense in mail groups.  If these commands are
illegal in the current group, they will raise hell and let you know.

All these commands (except the expiry and edit commands) use the
process/prefix convention (*Note Process/Prefix::).


`B e'
     Expire all expirable articles in the group
     (`gnus-summary-expire-articles').

`B M-C-e'
     Delete all the expirable articles in the group
     (`gnus-summary-expire-articles-now').  This means that *all*
     articles eligible for expiry in the current group will disappear
     forever into that big `/dev/null' in the sky.

`B DEL'
     Delete the mail article.  This is "delete" as in "delete it from
     your disk forever and ever, never to return again." Use with
     caution.  (`gnus-summary-delete-article').

`B m'
     Move the article from one mail group to another
     (`gnus-summary-move-article').

`B c'
     Copy the article from one group (mail group or not) to a mail group
     (`gnus-summary-copy-article').

`B C'
     Crosspost the current article to some other group
     (`gnus-summary-crosspost-article').  This will create a new copy of
     the article in the other group, and the Xref headers of the article
     will be properly updated.

`B i'
     Import an arbitrary file into the current mail newsgroup
     (`gnus-summary-import-article').  You will be prompted for a file
     name, a `From' header and a `Subject' header.

`B r'
     Respool the mail article (`gnus-summary-move-article').
     `gnus-summary-respool-default-method' will be used as the default
     select method when respooling.  This variable is `nil' by default,
     which means that the current group select method will be used
     instead.

`B w'
`e'
     Edit the current article (`gnus-summary-edit-article').  To finish
     editing and make the changes permanent, type `C-c C-c'
     (`gnus-summary-edit-article-done').

`B q'
     If you want to re-spool an article, you might be curious as to what
     group the article will end up in before you do the re-spooling.
     This command will tell you (`gnus-summary-respool-query').

`B p'
     Some people have a tendency to send you "courtesy" copies when they
     follow up to articles you have posted.  These usually have a
     `Newsgroups' header in them, but not always.  This command
     (`gnus-summary-article-posted-p') will try to fetch the current
     article from your news server (or rather, from
     `gnus-refer-article-method' or `gnus-select-method') and will
     report back whether it found the article or not.  Even if it says
     that it didn't find the article, it may have been posted
     anyway--mail propagation is much faster than news propagation, and
     the news copy may just not have arrived yet.


If you move (or copy) articles regularly, you might wish to have Gnus
suggest where to put the articles.  `gnus-move-split-methods' is a
variable that uses the same syntax as `gnus-split-methods' (*Note Saving
Articles::).  You may customize that variable to create suggestions you
find reasonable.

     (setq gnus-move-split-methods
           '(("^From:.*Lars Magne" "nnml:junk")
             ("^Subject:.*gnus" "nnfolder:important")
             (".*" "nnml:misc")))

Various Summary Stuff
=====================

* Menu:

* Summary Group Information::         Information oriented commands.
* Searching for Articles::            Multiple article commands.
* Summary Generation Commands::       (Re)generating the summary buffer.
* Really Various Summary Commands::   Those pesky non-conformant commands.

`gnus-summary-mode-hook'
     This hook is called when creating a summary mode buffer.

`gnus-summary-generate-hook'
     This is called as the last thing before doing the threading and the
     generation of the summary buffer.  It's quite convenient for
     customizing the threading variables based on what data the
     newsgroup has.  This hook is called from the summary buffer after
     most summary buffer variables have been set.

`gnus-summary-prepare-hook'
     It is called after the summary buffer has been generated.  You
     might use it to, for instance, highlight lines or modify the look
     of the buffer in some other ungodly manner.  I don't care.

`gnus-summary-ignore-duplicates'
     When Gnus discovers two articles that have the same `Message-ID',
     it has to do something drastic.  No articles are allowed to have
     the same `Message-ID', but this may happen when reading mail from
     some sources.  Gnus allows you to customize what happens with this
     variable.  If it is `nil' (which is the default), Gnus will rename
     the `Message-ID' (for display purposes only) and display the
     article as any other article.  If this variable is `t', it won't
     display the article--it'll be as if it never existed.





File: gnus, Node: Summary Group Information, Next: Searching for Articles, Prev: Various Summary Stuff, Up: Various Summary Stuff

Summary Group Information
-------------------------


`H f'
     Try to fetch the FAQ (list of frequently asked questions) for the
     current group (`gnus-summary-fetch-faq').  Gnus will try to get the
     FAQ from `gnus-group-faq-directory', which is usually a directory
     on a remote machine.  This variable can also be a list of
     directories.  In that case, giving a prefix to this command will
     allow you to choose between the various sites.  `ange-ftp' or `efs'
     will probably be used for fetching the file.

`H d'
     Give a brief description of the current group
     (`gnus-summary-describe-group').  If given a prefix, force
     rereading the description from the server.

`H h'
     Give an extremely brief description of the most important summary
     keystrokes (`gnus-summary-describe-briefly').

`H i'
     Go to the Gnus info node (`gnus-info-find-node').




File: gnus, Node: Searching for Articles, Next: Summary Generation Commands, Prev: Summary Group Information, Up: Various Summary Stuff

Searching for Articles
----------------------


`M-s'
     Search through all subsequent articles for a regexp
     (`gnus-summary-search-article-forward').

`M-r'
     Search through all previous articles for a regexp
     (`gnus-summary-search-article-backward').

`&'
     This command will prompt you for a header field, a regular
     expression to match on this field, and a command to be executed if
     the match is made (`gnus-summary-execute-command').  If given a
     prefix, search backward instead.

`M-&'
     Perform any operation on all articles that have been marked with
     the process mark (`gnus-summary-universal-argument').



File: gnus, Node: Summary Generation Commands, Next: Really Various Summary Commands, Prev: Searching for Articles, Up: Various Summary Stuff

Summary Generation Commands
---------------------------


`Y g'
     Regenerate the current summary buffer (`gnus-summary-prepare').

`Y c'
     Pull all cached articles (for the current group) into the summary
     buffer (`gnus-summary-insert-cached-articles').





File: gnus, Node: Really Various Summary Commands, Prev: Summary Generation Commands, Up: Various Summary Stuff

Really Various Summary Commands
-------------------------------


`C-d'
     If the current article is a collection of other articles (for
     instance, a digest), you might use this command to enter a group
     based on the that article (`gnus-summary-enter-digest-group').
     Gnus will try to guess what article type is currently displayed
     unless you give a prefix to this command, which forces a "digest"
     interpretation.  Basically, whenever you see a message that is a
     collection of other messages of some format, you `C-d' and read
     these messages in a more convenient fashion.

`M-C-d'
     This command is very similar to the one above, but lets you gather
     several documents into one biiig group
     (`gnus-summary-read-document').  It does this by opening several
     `nndoc' groups for each document, and then opening an `nnvirtual'
     group on top of these `nndoc' groups.  This command understands the
     process/prefix convention (*Note Process/Prefix::).

`C-t'
     Toggle truncation of summary lines
     (`gnus-summary-toggle-truncation').  This will probably confuse the
     line centering function in the summary buffer, so it's not a good
     idea to have truncation switched off while reading articles.

`='
     Expand the summary buffer window (`gnus-summary-expand-window').
     If given a prefix, force an `article' window configuration.





File: gnus, Node: Exiting the Summary Buffer, Next: Crosspost Handling, Prev: Various Summary Stuff, Up: The Summary Buffer

Exiting the Summary Buffer
==========================

Exiting from the summary buffer will normally update all info on the
group and return you to the group buffer.


`Z Z'
`q'
     Exit the current group and update all information on the group
     (`gnus-summary-exit'). `gnus-summary-prepare-exit-hook' is called
     before doing much of the exiting, which calls
     `gnus-summary-expire-articles' by default.
     `gnus-summary-exit-hook' is called after finishing the exit
     process.  `gnus-group-no-more-groups-hook' is run when returning to
     group mode having no more (unread) groups.

`Z E'
`Q'
     Exit the current group without updating any information on the
     group (`gnus-summary-exit-no-update').

`Z c'
`c'
     Mark all unticked articles in the group as read and then exit
     (`gnus-summary-catchup-and-exit').

`Z C'
     Mark all articles, even the ticked ones, as read and then exit
     (`gnus-summary-catchup-all-and-exit').

`Z n'
     Mark all articles as read and go to the next group
     (`gnus-summary-catchup-and-goto-next-group').

`Z R'
     Exit this group, and then enter it again
     (`gnus-summary-reselect-current-group').  If given a prefix, select
     all articles, both read and unread.

`Z G'
`M-g'
     Exit the group, check for new articles in the group, and select the
     group (`gnus-summary-rescan-group').  If given a prefix, select all
     articles, both read and unread.

`Z N'
     Exit the group and go to the next group
     (`gnus-summary-next-group').

`Z P'
     Exit the group and go to the previous group
     (`gnus-summary-prev-group').

`Z s'
     Save the current number of read/marked articles in the dribble
     buffer and then save the dribble buffer
     (`gnus-summary-save-newsrc').  If given a prefix, also save the
     `.newsrc' file(s).  Using this command will make exit without
     updating (the `Q' command) worthless.

`gnus-exit-group-hook' is called when you exit the current group.

If you're in the habit of exiting groups, and then changing your mind
about it, you might set `gnus-kill-summary-on-exit' to `nil'.  If you do
that, Gnus won't kill the summary buffer when you exit it.  (Quelle
surprise!)  Instead it will change the name of the buffer to something
like `*Dead Summary ... *' and install a minor mode called
`gnus-dead-summary-mode'.  Now, if you switch back to this buffer,
you'll find that all keys are mapped to a function called
`gnus-summary-wake-up-the-dead'.  So tapping any keys in a dead summary
buffer will result in a live, normal summary buffer.

There will never be more than one dead summary buffer at any one time.

The data on the current group will be updated (which articles you have
read, which articles you have replied to, etc.) when you exit the
summary buffer.  If the `gnus-use-cross-reference' variable is `t'
(which is the default), articles that are cross-referenced to this group
and are marked as read, will also be marked as read in the other
subscribed groups they were cross-posted to.  If this variable is
neither `nil' nor `t', the article will be marked as read in both
subscribed and unsubscribed groups (*Note Crosspost Handling::).




File: gnus, Node: Crosspost Handling, Next: Duplicate Suppression, Prev: Exiting the Summary Buffer, Up: The Summary Buffer

Crosspost Handling
==================

Marking cross-posted articles as read ensures that you'll never have to
read the same article more than once.  Unless, of course, somebody has
posted it to several groups separately.  Posting the same article to
several groups (not cross-posting) is called "spamming", and you are by
law required to send nasty-grams to anyone who perpetrates such a
heinous crime.  You may want to try NoCeM handling to filter out spam
(*Note NoCeM::).

Remember: Cross-posting is kinda ok, but posting the same article
separately to several groups is not.  Massive cross-posting (aka.
"velveeta") is to be avoided at all costs, and you can even use the
`gnus-summary-mail-crosspost-complaint' command to complain about
excessive crossposting (*Note Summary Mail Commands::).

One thing that may cause Gnus to not do the cross-posting thing
correctly is if you use an NNTP server that supports XOVER (which is
very nice, because it speeds things up considerably) which does not
include the `Xref' header in its NOV lines.  This is Evil, but all too
common, alas, alack.  Gnus tries to Do The Right Thing even with XOVER
by registering the `Xref' lines of all articles you actually read, but
if you kill the articles, or just mark them as read without reading
them, Gnus will not get a chance to snoop the `Xref' lines out of these
articles, and will be unable to use the cross reference mechanism.

To check whether your NNTP server includes the `Xref' header in its
overview files, try `telnet your.nntp.server nntp', `MODE READER' on
`inn' servers, and then say `LIST overview.fmt'.  This may not work, but
if it does, and the last line you get does not read `Xref:full', then
you should shout and whine at your news admin until she includes the
`Xref' header in the overview files.

If you want Gnus to get the `Xref's right all the time, you have to set
`gnus-nov-is-evil' to `t', which slows things down considerably.

C'est la vie.

For an alternative approach, *Note Duplicate Suppression::.




File: gnus, Node: Duplicate Suppression, Prev: Crosspost Handling, Up: The Summary Buffer

Duplicate Suppression
=====================

By default, Gnus tries to make sure that you don't have to read the same
article more than once by utilizing the crossposting mechanism (*Note
Crosspost Handling::).  However, that simple and efficient approach may
not work satisfactory for some users for various reasons.

  1. The NNTP server may fail to generate the `Xref' header.  This is
     evil and not very common.

  2. The NNTP server may fail to include the `Xref' header in the
     `.overview' data bases.  This is evil and all too common, alas.

  3. You may be reading the same group (or several related groups) from
     different NNTP servers.

  4. You may be getting mail that duplicates articles posted to groups.

I'm sure there are other situations where `Xref' handling fails as well,
but these four are the most common situations.

If, and only if, `Xref' handling fails for you, then you may consider
switching on "duplicate suppression".  If you do so, Gnus will remember
the `Message-ID's of all articles you have read or otherwise marked as
read, and then, as if by magic, mark them as read all subsequent times
you see them--in *all* groups.  Using this mechanism is quite likely to
be somewhat inefficient, but not overly so.  It's certainly preferable
to reading the same articles more than once.

Duplicate suppression is not a very subtle instrument.  It's more like a
sledge hammer than anything else.  It works in a very simple fashion--if
you have marked an article as read, it adds this Message-ID to a cache.
The next time it sees this Message-ID, it will mark the article as read
with the `M' mark.  It doesn't care what group it saw the article in.

`gnus-suppress-duplicates'
     If non-`nil', suppress duplicates.

`gnus-save-duplicate-list'
     If non-`nil', save the list of duplicates to a file.  This will
     make startup and shutdown take longer, so the default is `nil'.
     However, this means that only duplicate articles read in a single
     Gnus session are suppressed.

`gnus-duplicate-list-length'
     This variable says how many `Message-ID's to keep in the duplicate
     suppression list.  The default is 10000.

`gnus-duplicate-file'
     The name of the file to store the duplicate suppression list in.
     The default is `~/News/suppression'.

If you have a tendency to stop and start Gnus often, setting
`gnus-save-duplicate-list' to `t' is probably a good idea.  If you leave
Gnus running for weeks on end, you may have it `nil'.  On the other
hand, saving the list makes startup and shutdown much slower, so that
means that if you stop and start Gnus often, you should set
`gnus-save-duplicate-list' to `nil'.  Uhm.  I'll leave this up to you to
figure out, I think.
