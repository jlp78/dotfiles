Various XEmacs Variables
------------------------

`gnus-xmas-glyph-directory'
     This is where Gnus will look for pictures.  Gnus will normally
     auto-detect this directory, but you may set it manually if you have
     an unusual directory structure.

`gnus-xmas-logo-color-alist'
     This is an alist where the key is a type symbol and the values are
     the foreground and background color of the splash page glyph.

`gnus-xmas-logo-color-style'
     This is the key used to look up the color in the alist described
     above.  Legal values include `flame', `pine', `moss', `irish',
     `sky', `tin', `velvet', `grape', `labia', `berry', `neutral', and
     `september'.

`gnus-xmas-modeline-glyph'
     A glyph displayed in all Gnus mode lines.  It is a tiny gnu head by
     default.

Fuzzy Matching
==============

Gnus provides "fuzzy matching" of `Subject' lines when doing things like
scoring, thread gathering and thread comparison.

As opposed to regular expression matching, fuzzy matching is very fuzzy.
It's so fuzzy that there's not even a definition of what "fuzziness"
means, and the implementation has changed over time.

Basically, it tries to remove all noise from lines before comparing.
`Re: ', parenthetical remarks, white space, and so on, are filtered out
of the strings before comparing the results.  This often leads to
adequate results--even when faced with strings generated by text
manglers masquerading as newsreaders.

Thwarting Email Spam
====================

In these last days of the Usenet, commercial vultures are hanging about
and grepping through news like crazy to find email addresses they can
foist off their scams and products to.  As a reaction to this, many
people have started putting nonsense addresses into their `From' lines.
I think this is counterproductive--it makes it difficult for people to
send you legitimate mail in response to things you write, as well as
making it difficult to see who wrote what.  This rewriting may perhaps
be a bigger menace than the unsolicited commercial email itself in the
end.

The biggest problem I have with email spam is that it comes in under
false pretenses.  I press `g' and Gnus merrily informs me that I have 10
new emails.  I say "Golly gee!  Happy is me!" and select the mail group,
only to find two pyramid schemes, seven advertisements ("New!  Miracle
tonic for growing full, lustrouos hair on your toes!")  and one mail
asking me to repent and find some god.

This is annoying.

The way to deal with this is having Gnus split out all spam into a
`spam' mail group (*Note Splitting Mail::).

First, pick one (1) legal mail address that you can be reached at, and
put it in your `From' header of all your news articles.  (I've chosen
`larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no', but for many addresses on the form
`larsi+usenet@ifi.uio.no' will be a better choice.  Ask your sysadm
whether your sendmail installation accepts keywords in the local part of
the mail address.)

     (setq message-default-news-headers
           "From: Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen <larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no>\n")

Then put the following split rule in `nnmail-split-fancy' (*Note Fancy
Mail Splitting::):

     (
      ...
      (to "larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no"
           (| ("subject" "re:.*" "misc")
              ("references" ".*@.*" "misc")
              "spam"))
      ...
     )

This says that all mail to this address is suspect, but if it has a
`Subject' that starts with a `Re:' or has a `References' header, it's
probably ok.  All the rest goes to the `spam' group.  (This idea
probably comes from Tim Pierce.)

In addition, many mail spammers talk directly to your `smtp' server and
do not include your email address explicitly in the `To' header.  Why
they do this is unknown--perhaps it's to thwart this twarting scheme?
In any case, this is trivial to deal with--you just put anything not
addressed to you in the `spam' group by ending your fancy split rule in
this way:

     (
      ...
      (to "larsi" "misc")
      "spam")

In my experience, this will sort virtually everything into the right
group.  You still have to check the `spam' group from time to time to
check for legitimate mail, though.  If you feel like being a good net
citizen, you can even send off complaints to the proper authorities on
each unsolicited commercial email--at your leisure.

If you are also a lazy net citizen, you will probably prefer complaining
automatically with the `gnus-junk.el' package, availiable FOR FREE at
`<URL:http://stud2.tuwien.ac.at/~e9426626/gnus-junk.html>'.  Since most
e-mail spam is sent automatically, this may reconcile the cosmic balance
somewhat.

This works for me.  It allows people an easy way to contact me (they can
just press `r' in the usual way), and I'm not bothered at all with spam.
It's a win-win situation.  Forging `From' headers to point to
non-existant domains is yucky, in my opinion.

Various Various
===============


`gnus-home-directory'
     All Gnus path variables will be initialized from this variable,
     which defaults to `~/'.

`gnus-directory'
     Most Gnus storage path variables will be initialized from this
     variable, which defaults to the `SAVEDIR' environment variable, or
     `~/News/' if that variable isn't set.

`gnus-default-directory'
     Not related to the above variable at all--this variable says what
     the default directory of all Gnus buffers should be.  If you issue
     commands like `C-x C-f', the prompt you'll get starts in the
     current buffer's default directory.  If this variable is `nil'
     (which is the default), the default directory will be the default
     directory of the buffer you were in when you started Gnus.

`gnus-verbose'
     This variable is an integer between zero and ten.  The higher the
     value, the more messages will be displayed.  If this variable is
     zero, Gnus will never flash any messages, if it is seven (which is
     the default), most important messages will be shown, and if it is
     ten, Gnus won't ever shut up, but will flash so many messages it
     will make your head swim.

`gnus-verbose-backends'
     This variable works the same way as `gnus-verbose', but it applies
     to the Gnus backends instead of Gnus proper.

`nnheader-max-head-length'
     When the backends read straight heads of articles, they all try to
     read as little as possible.  This variable (default 4096) specifies
     the absolute max length the backends will try to read before giving
     up on finding a separator line between the head and the body.  If
     this variable is `nil', there is no upper read bound.  If it is
     `t', the backends won't try to read the articles piece by piece,
     but read the entire articles.  This makes sense with some versions
     of `ange-ftp' or `efs'.

`nnheader-head-chop-length'
     This variable (default 2048) says how big a piece of each article
     to read when doing the operation described above.

`nnheader-file-name-translation-alist'
     This is an alist that says how to translate characters in file
     names.  For instance, if `:' is illegal as a file character in file
     names on your system (you OS/2 user you), you could say something
     like:

          (setq nnheader-file-name-translation-alist 
                '((?: . ?_)))

     In fact, this is the default value for this variable on OS/2 and MS
     Windows (phooey) systems.

`gnus-hidden-properties'
     This is a list of properties to use to hide "invisible" text.  It
     is `(invisible t intangible t)' by default on most systems, which
     makes invisible text invisible and intangible.

`gnus-parse-headers-hook'
     A hook called before parsing headers.  It can be used, for
     instance, to gather statistics on the headers fetched, or perhaps
     you'd like to prune some headers.  I don't see why you'd want that,
     though.

`gnus-shell-command-separator'
     String used to separate two shell commands.  The default is `;'.

History
=======

GNUS was written by Masanobu UMEDA.  When autumn crept up in '94, Lars
Magne Ingebrigtsen grew bored and decided to rewrite Gnus.

If you want to investigate the person responsible for this outrage, you
can point your (feh!) web browser to `http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/'.
This is also the primary distribution point for the new and spiffy
versions of Gnus, and is known as The Site That Destroys Newsrcs And
Drives People Mad.

During the first extended alpha period of development, the new Gnus was
called "(ding) Gnus".  "(ding)" is, of course, short for "ding is not
Gnus", which is a total and utter lie, but who cares?  (Besides, the
"Gnus" in this abbreviation should probably be pronounced "news" as
UMEDA intended, which makes it a more appropriate name, don't you
think?)

In any case, after spending all that energy on coming up with a new and
spunky name, we decided that the name was *too* spunky, so we renamed it
back again to "Gnus".  But in mixed case.  "Gnus" vs.  "GNUS".  New
vs. old.

The first "proper" release of Gnus 5 was done in November 1995 when it
was included in the Emacs 19.30 distribution (132 (ding) Gnus releases
plus 15 Gnus 5.0 releases).

In May 1996 the next Gnus generation (aka. "September Gnus" (after 99
releases)) was released under the name "Gnus 5.2" (40 releases).

On July 28th 1996 work on Red Gnus was begun, and it was released on
January 25th 1997 (after 84 releases) as "Gnus 5.4".

If you happen upon a version of Gnus that has a prefixed name -- "(ding)
Gnus", "September Gnus", "Red Gnus", "Quassia Gnus" -- don't panic.
Don't let it know that you're frightened.  Back away.  Slowly.  Whatever
you do, don't run.  Walk away, calmly, until you're out of its reach.
Find a proper released version of Gnus and snuggle up to that instead.

Why?
----

What's the point of Gnus?

I want to provide a "rad", "happening", "way cool" and "hep" newsreader,
that lets you do anything you can think of.  That was my original
motivation, but while working on Gnus, it has become clear to me that
this generation of newsreaders really belong in the stone age.
Newsreaders haven't developed much since the infancy of the net.  If the
volume continues to rise with the current rate of increase, all current
newsreaders will be pretty much useless.  How do you deal with
newsgroups that have thousands of new articles each day?  How do you
keep track of millions of people who post?

Gnus offers no real solutions to these questions, but I would very much
like to see Gnus being used as a testing ground for new methods of
reading and fetching news.  Expanding on UMEDA-san's wise decision to
separate the newsreader from the backends, Gnus now offers a simple
interface for anybody who wants to write new backends for fetching mail
and news from different sources.  I have added hooks for customizations
everywhere I could imagine it being useful.  By doing so, I'm inviting
every one of you to explore and invent.

May Gnus never be complete. `C-u 100 M-x all-hail-emacs' and `C-u 100
M-x all-hail-xemacs'.




File: gnus, Node: Compatibility, Next: Conformity, Prev: Why?, Up: History

Compatibility
-------------

Gnus was designed to be fully compatible with GNUS.  Almost all key
bindings have been kept.  More key bindings have been added, of course,
but only in one or two obscure cases have old bindings been changed.

Our motto is:
                         In a cloud bones of steel.

All commands have kept their names.  Some internal functions have
changed their names.

The `gnus-uu' package has changed drastically. *Note Decoding
Articles::.

One major compatibility question is the presence of several summary
buffers.  All variables relevant while reading a group are buffer-local
to the summary buffer they belong in.  Although many important variables
have their values copied into their global counterparts whenever a
command is executed in the summary buffer, this change might lead to
incorrect values being used unless you are careful.

All code that relies on knowledge of GNUS internals will probably fail.
To take two examples: Sorting `gnus-newsrc-alist' (or changing it in any
way, as a matter of fact) is strictly verboten.  Gnus maintains a hash
table that points to the entries in this alist (which speeds up many
functions), and changing the alist directly will lead to peculiar
results.

Old hilit19 code does not work at all.  In fact, you should probably
remove all hilit code from all Gnus hooks (`gnus-group-prepare-hook' and
`gnus-summary-prepare-hook').  Gnus provides various integrated
functions for highlighting.  These are faster and more accurate.  To
make life easier for everybody, Gnus will by default remove all hilit
calls from all hilit hooks.  Uncleanliness!  Away!

Packages like `expire-kill' will no longer work.  As a matter of fact,
you should probably remove all old GNUS packages (and other code) when
you start using Gnus.  More likely than not, Gnus already does what you
have written code to make GNUS do.  (Snicker.)

Even though old methods of doing things are still supported, only the
new methods are documented in this manual.  If you detect a new method
of doing something while reading this manual, that does not mean you
have to stop doing it the old way.

Gnus understands all GNUS startup files.

Overall, a casual user who hasn't written much code that depends on GNUS
internals should suffer no problems.  If problems occur, please let me
know by issuing that magic command `M-x gnus-bug'.

Conformity
----------

No rebels without a clue here, ma'am.  We conform to all standards known
to (wo)man.  Except for those standards and/or conventions we disagree
with, of course.


*RFC 822*
     There are no known breaches of this standard.

*RFC 1036*
     There are no known breaches of this standard, either.

*Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval*
     Gnus has been through the Seal process and failed.  I think it'll
     pass the next inspection.

*Son-of-RFC 1036*
     We do have some breaches to this one.


     *MIME*
          Gnus does no MIME handling, and this standard-to-be seems to
          think that MIME is the bees' knees, so we have major breakage
          here.

     *X-Newsreader*
          This is considered to be a "vanity header", while I consider
          it to be consumer information.  After seeing so many badly
          formatted articles coming from `tin' and `Netscape' I know not
          to use either of those for posting articles.  I would not have
          known that if it wasn't for the `X-Newsreader' header.


If you ever notice Gnus acting non-compliant with regards to the texts
mentioned above, don't hesitate to drop a note to Gnus Towers and let us
know.




File: gnus, Node: Emacsen, Next: Contributors, Prev: Conformity, Up: History

Emacsen
-------

Gnus should work on :


   * Emacs 19.32 and up.

   * XEmacs 19.14 and up.

   * Mule versions based on Emacs 19.32 and up.


Gnus will absolutely not work on any Emacsen older than that.  Not
reliably, at least.

There are some vague differences between Gnus on the various
platforms--XEmacs features more graphics (a logo and a toolbar)---but
other than that, things should look pretty much the same under all
Emacsen.

Contributors
------------

The new Gnus version couldn't have been done without the help of all the
people on the (ding) mailing list.  Every day for over a year I have
gotten billions of nice bug reports from them, filling me with joy,
every single one of them.  Smooches.  The people on the list have been
tried beyond endurance, what with my "oh, that's a neat idea <type
type>, yup, I'll release it right away <ship off> no wait, that doesn't
work at all <type type>, yup, I'll ship that one off right away <ship
off> no, wait, that absolutely does not work" policy for releases.
Micro$oft--bah.  Amateurs.  I'm *much* worse.  (Or is that "worser"?
"much worser"?  "worsest"?)

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Academy for...  oops,
wrong show.


   * Masanobu UMEDA---the writer of the original GNUS.

(ding) Gnus
...........

New features in Gnus 5.0/5.1:


   * The look of all buffers can be changed by setting format-like
     variables (*Note Group Buffer Format:: and *Note Summary Buffer
     Format::).
 
   * Local spool and several NNTP servers can be used at once (*Note
     Select Methods::).

   * You can combine groups into virtual groups (*Note Virtual
     Groups::).

   * You can read a number of different mail formats (*Note Getting
     Mail::).  All the mail backends implement a convenient mail expiry
     scheme (*Note Expiring Mail::).

   * Gnus can use various strategies for gathering threads that have
     lost their roots (thereby gathering loose sub-threads into one
     thread) or it can go back and retrieve enough headers to build a
     complete thread (*Note Customizing Threading::).

   * Killed groups can be displayed in the group buffer, and you can
     read them as well (*Note Listing Groups::).

   * Gnus can do partial group updates--you do not have to retrieve the
     entire active file just to check for new articles in a few groups
     (*Note The Active File::).

   * Gnus implements a sliding scale of subscribedness to groups (*Note
     Group Levels::).

   * You can score articles according to any number of criteria (*Note
     Scoring::).  You can even get Gnus to find out how to score
     articles for you (*Note Adaptive Scoring::).

   * Gnus maintains a dribble buffer that is auto-saved the normal Emacs
     manner, so it should be difficult to lose much data on what you
     have read if your machine should go down (*Note Auto Save::).

   * Gnus now has its own startup file (`.gnus') to avoid cluttering up
     the `.emacs' file.

   * You can set the process mark on both groups and articles and
     perform operations on all the marked items (*Note
     Process/Prefix::).

   * You can grep through a subset of groups and create a group from the
     results (*Note Kibozed Groups::).

Also known as the "todo list".  Sure to be implemented before the next
millennium.

Be afraid.  Be very afraid.

   * Native MIME support is something that should be done.
   * Really do unbinhexing.

And much, much, much more.  There is more to come than has already been
implemented.  (But that's always true, isn't it?)

`<URL:http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/rgnus/todo>' is where the actual
up-to-the-second todo list is located, so if you're really curious, you
could point your Web browser over that-a-way.





File: gnus, Node: Terminology, Next: Customization, Prev: The Manual, Up: Appendices

Terminology
===========


"news"
     This is what you are supposed to use this thing for--reading news.
     News is generally fetched from a nearby NNTP server, and is
     generally publicly available to everybody.  If you post news, the
     entire world is likely to read just what you have written, and
     they'll all snigger mischievously.  Behind your back.

"mail"
     Everything that's delivered to you personally is mail.  Some
     news/mail readers (like Gnus) blur the distinction between mail and
     news, but there is a difference.  Mail is private.  News is public.
     Mailing is not posting, and replying is not following up.

"reply"
     Send a mail to the person who has written what you are reading.

"follow up"
     Post an article to the current newsgroup responding to the article
     you are reading.

"backend"
     Gnus gets fed articles from a number of backends, both news and
     mail backends.  Gnus does not handle the underlying media, so to
     speak--this is all done by the backends.

"native"
     Gnus will always use one method (and backend) as the "native", or
     default, way of getting news.

"foreign"
     You can also have any number of foreign groups active at the same
     time.  These are groups that use non-native non-secondary backends
     for getting news.

"secondary"
     Secondary backends are somewhere half-way between being native and
     being foreign, but they mostly act like they are native.

"article"
     A message that has been posted as news.

"mail message"
     A message that has been mailed.

"message"
     A mail message or news article

"head"
     The top part of a message, where administrative information (etc.)
     is put.

"body"
     The rest of an article.  Everything not in the head is in the body.

"header"
     A line from the head of an article.

"headers"
     A collection of such lines, or a collection of heads.  Or even a
     collection of NOV lines.

"NOV"
     When Gnus enters a group, it asks the backend for the headers of
     all unread articles in the group.  Most servers support the News
     OverView format, which is more compact and much faster to read and
     parse than the normal HEAD format.

"level"
     Each group is subscribed at some "level" or other (1-9).  The ones
     that have a lower level are "more" subscribed than the groups with
     a higher level.  In fact, groups on levels 1-5 are considered
     "subscribed"; 6-7 are "unsubscribed"; 8 are "zombies"; and 9 are
     "killed".  Commands for listing groups and scanning for new
     articles will all use the numeric prefix as "working level".

"killed groups"
     No information on killed groups is stored or updated, which makes
     killed groups much easier to handle than subscribed groups.

"zombie groups"
     Just like killed groups, only slightly less dead.

"active file"
     The news server has to keep track of what articles it carries, and
     what groups exist.  All this information in stored in the active
     file, which is rather large, as you might surmise.

"bogus groups"
     A group that exists in the `.newsrc' file, but isn't known to the
     server (i.e., it isn't in the active file), is a *bogus group*.
     This means that the group probably doesn't exist (any more).

"server"
     A machine one can connect to and get news (or mail) from.

"select method"
     A structure that specifies the backend, the server and the virtual
     server parameters.

"virtual server"
     A named select method.  Since a select method defines all there is
     to know about connecting to a (physical) server, taking the thing
     as a whole is a virtual server.

"washing"
     Taking a buffer and running it through a filter of some sort.  The
     result will (more often than not) be cleaner and more pleasing than
     the original.

"ephemeral groups"
     Most groups store data on what articles you have read.  "Ephemeral"
     groups are groups that will have no data stored--when you exit the
     group, it'll disappear into the aether.

"solid groups"
     This is the opposite of ephemeral groups.  All groups listed in the
     group buffer are solid groups.

"sparse articles"
     These are article placeholders shown in the summary buffer when
     `gnus-build-sparse-threads' has been switched on.

Customization
=============

All variables are properly documented elsewhere in this manual.  This
section is designed to give general pointers on how to customize Gnus
for some quite common situations.

* Menu:

* Slow/Expensive Connection:: You run a local Emacs and get the news elsewhere.
* Slow Terminal Connection::  You run a remote Emacs.
* Little Disk Space::         You feel that having large setup files is icky.
* Slow Machine::              You feel like buying a faster machine.




File: gnus, Node: Slow/Expensive Connection, Next: Slow Terminal Connection, Prev: Customization, Up: Customization

Slow/Expensive NNTP Connection
------------------------------

If you run Emacs on a machine locally, and get your news from a machine
over some very thin strings, you want to cut down on the amount of data
Gnus has to get from the NNTP server.


`gnus-read-active-file'
     Set this to `nil', which will inhibit Gnus from requesting the
     entire active file from the server.  This file is often v.  large.
     You also have to set `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' and
     `gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups' to `nil' to make sure that Gnus
     doesn't suddenly decide to fetch the active file anyway.

`gnus-nov-is-evil'
     This one has to be `nil'.  If not, grabbing article headers from
     the NNTP server will not be very fast.  Not all NNTP servers
     support XOVER; Gnus will detect this by itself.




File: gnus, Node: Slow Terminal Connection, Next: Little Disk Space, Prev: Slow/Expensive Connection, Up: Customization

Slow Terminal Connection
------------------------

Let's say you use your home computer for dialing up the system that runs
Emacs and Gnus.  If your modem is slow, you want to reduce (as much as
possible) the amount of data sent over the wires.


`gnus-auto-center-summary'
     Set this to `nil' to inhibit Gnus from re-centering the summary
     buffer all the time.  If it is `vertical', do only vertical
     re-centering.  If it is neither `nil' nor `vertical', do both
     horizontal and vertical recentering.

`gnus-visible-headers'
     Cut down on the headers included in the articles to the minimum.
     You can, in fact, make do without them altogether--most of the
     useful data is in the summary buffer, anyway.  Set this variable to
     `^NEVVVVER' or `From:', or whatever you feel you need.

`gnus-article-display-hook'
     Set this hook to all the available hiding commands:
          (setq gnus-article-display-hook 
                '(gnus-article-hide-headers gnus-article-hide-signature
                  gnus-article-hide-citation))

`gnus-use-full-window'
     By setting this to `nil', you can make all the windows smaller.
     While this doesn't really cut down much generally, it means that
     you have to see smaller portions of articles before deciding that
     you didn't want to read them anyway.

`gnus-thread-hide-subtree'
     If this is non-`nil', all threads in the summary buffer will be
     hidden initially.

`gnus-updated-mode-lines'
     If this is `nil', Gnus will not put information in the buffer mode
     lines, which might save some time.




File: gnus, Node: Little Disk Space, Next: Slow Machine, Prev: Slow Terminal Connection, Up: Customization

Little Disk Space
-----------------

The startup files can get rather large, so you may want to cut their
sizes a bit if you are running out of space.


`gnus-save-newsrc-file'
     If this is `nil', Gnus will never save `.newsrc'---it will only
     save `.newsrc.eld'.  This means that you will not be able to use
     any other newsreaders than Gnus.  This variable is `t' by default.

`gnus-save-killed-list'
     If this is `nil', Gnus will not save the list of dead groups.  You
     should also set `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' to `ask-server' and
     `gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups' to `nil' if you set this variable to
     `nil'.  This variable is `t' by default.





File: gnus, Node: Slow Machine, Prev: Little Disk Space, Up: Customization

Slow Machine
------------

If you have a slow machine, or are just really impatient, there are a
few things you can do to make Gnus run faster.

Set `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' and `gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups' to
`nil' to make startup faster.

Set `gnus-show-threads', `gnus-use-cross-reference' and
`gnus-nov-is-evil' to `nil' to make entering and exiting the summary
buffer faster.

Set `gnus-article-display-hook' to `nil' to make article processing a
bit faster.




File: gnus, Node: Troubleshooting, Next: A Programmers Guide to Gnus, Prev: Customization, Up: Appendices

Troubleshooting
===============

Gnus works *so* well straight out of the box--I can't imagine any
problems, really.

Ahem.


  1. Make sure your computer is switched on.

  2. Make sure that you really load the current Gnus version.  If you
     have been running GNUS, you need to exit Emacs and start it up
     again before Gnus will work.

  3. Try doing an `M-x gnus-version'.  If you get something that looks
     like `Gnus v5.46; nntp 4.0' you have the right files loaded.  If,
     on the other hand, you get something like `NNTP 3.x' or `nntp
     flee', you have some old `.el' files lying around.  Delete these.

  4. Read the help group (`G h' in the group buffer) for a FAQ and a
     how-to.

  5. Gnus works on many recursive structures, and in some extreme (and
     very rare) cases Gnus may recurse down "too deeply" and Emacs will
     beep at you.  If this happens to you, set `max-lisp-eval-depth' to
     500 or something like that.

If all else fails, report the problem as a bug.


If you find a bug in Gnus, you can report it with the `M-x gnus-bug'
command. `M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET', and send me
the backtrace.  I will fix bugs, but I can only fix them if you send me
a precise description as to how to reproduce the bug.

You really can never be too detailed in a bug report.  Always use the
`M-x gnus-bug' command when you make bug reports, even if it creates a
10Kb mail each time you use it, and even if you have sent me your
environment 500 times before.  I don't care.  I want the full info each
time.

It is also important to remember that I have no memory whatsoever.  If
you send a bug report, and I send you a reply, and then you just send
back "No, it's not! Moron!", I will have no idea what you are insulting
me about.  Always over-explain everything.  It's much easier for all of
us--if I don't have all the information I need, I will just mail you and
ask for more info, and everything takes more time.

If the problem you're seeing is very visual, and you can't quite explain
it, copy the Emacs window to a file (with `xwd', for instance), put it
somewhere it can be reached, and include the URL of the picture in the
bug report.

If you just need help, you are better off asking on `gnu.emacs.gnus'.
I'm not very helpful.

You can also ask on the ding mailing list---`ding@gnus.org'.  Write to
`ding-request@gnus.org' to subscribe.

A Programmer's Guide to Gnus
============================

It is my hope that other people will figure out smart stuff that Gnus
can do, and that other people will write those smart things as well.  To
facilitate that I thought it would be a good idea to describe the inner
workings of Gnus.  And some of the not-so-inner workings, while I'm at
it.

You can never expect the internals of a program not to change, but I
will be defining (in some details) the interface between Gnus and its
backends (this is written in stone), the format of the score files
(ditto), data structures (some are less likely to change than others)
and general methods of operation.

* Menu:

* Gnus Utility Functions::   Common functions and variable to use.
* Backend Interface::        How Gnus communicates with the servers.
* Score File Syntax::        A BNF definition of the score file standard.
* Headers::                  How Gnus stores headers internally.
* Ranges::                   A handy format for storing mucho numbers.
* Group Info::               The group info format.
* Emacs/XEmacs Code::        Gnus can be run under all modern Emacsen.
* Various File Formats::     Formats of files that Gnus use.

Gnus Utility Functions
----------------------

When writing small functions to be run from hooks (and stuff), it's
vital to have access to the Gnus internal functions and variables.
Below is a list of the most common ones.


`gnus-newsgroup-name'
     This variable holds the name of the current newsgroup.

`gnus-find-method-for-group'
     A function that returns the select method for GROUP.

`gnus-group-real-name'
     Takes a full (prefixed) Gnus group name, and returns the unprefixed
     name.

`gnus-group-prefixed-name'
     Takes an unprefixed group name and a select method, and returns the
     full (prefixed) Gnus group name.

`gnus-get-info'
     Returns the group info list for GROUP.

`gnus-add-current-to-buffer-list'
     Adds the current buffer to the list of buffers to be killed on Gnus
     exit.

`gnus-continuum-version'
     Takes a Gnus version string as a parameter and returns a floating
     point number.  Earlier versions will always get a lower number than
     later versions.

`gnus-group-read-only-p'
     Says whether GROUP is read-only or not.

`gnus-news-group-p'
     Says whether GROUP came from a news backend.

`gnus-ephemeral-group-p'
     Says whether GROUP is ephemeral or not.

`gnus-server-to-method'
     Returns the select method corresponding to SERVER.

`gnus-server-equal'
     Says whether two virtual servers are equal.

`gnus-group-native-p'
     Says whether GROUP is native or not.

`gnus-group-secondary-p'
     Says whether GROUP is secondary or not.

`gnus-group-foreign-p'
     Says whether GROUP is foreign or not.

`group-group-find-parameter'
     Returns the parameter list of GROUP.  If given a second parameter,
