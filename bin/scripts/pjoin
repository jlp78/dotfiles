# pjoin, access perl's join functionality for data from command line
#
# sometimes, we get a list of things that we actually want to be a
# comma separated list all on one line.  while we can use tr to change
# the linefeeds to commas, that also changes the last linefeed to a
# comma, which is probably not what we want.  perl's join function
# nicely does exactly what we want, but it's a pain to type it out all
# the time, so this script just collects it's stdin or arg list, joins
# it up with a comma separator, and dumps it back out

while (<>) {
    chomp;
    push(@list, $_);
}

print join(',', @list), "\n";
