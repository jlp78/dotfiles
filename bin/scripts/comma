# comma - take a list and return them as a comma separated list

# the naive implementation looks like this:
# while (<>) {
#   chomp;
#   push(@l, $_);
# }
# print join(',', @l), "\n";
#
# but this version consumes the entire list into memory.  fine if
# you've got a couple hundred, but maybe expensive if you've got a
# couple tens of thousands.

while (<>) {
  chomp;
  print $_;
} continue {
  print "," unless eof;
}
print "\n";
